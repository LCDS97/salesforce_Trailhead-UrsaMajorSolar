<br>

- [x] 1. **Create an Apex class with a method that returns a list of strings**

*Create an Apex class with a method that returns a list of formatted strings. The length of the list is determined by an integer parameter. You can also use an array if you prefer, but these instructions assume you‚Äôre using a list.*

<details><summary>üë£Stepsüë£</summary>

>   The Apex class must be called StringArrayTest and be in the public scope
-       The Apex class must have a public static method called generateStringArray
-       The generateStringArray method must return a list of strings
-       The method must accept an incoming Integer as a parameter, which will be used to determine the number of returned strings
-       The method must return a list of strings. Each element in the list must have the format Test n, where n is the index of the current string in the list.
-       For example, if the input is 3, then the output should be ['Test 0', 'Test 1', 'Test 2']. Remember that in Apex, the index position of the first element in a list is always 0.

- [x] 2. **Use sObjects**

*Explaining about sObjects in Salesforce, showing some instances and explaining about generic SOjbects to specific Sobjects*

<details><summary>‚ùî Questions ‚ùî</summary>

- 1. Describe the relationship between sObjects and Salesforce records.
    A: **(C)** - Every record in Salesforce is natively represented as an sObject in Apex

- 2. You can obtain an instance of an sObject, such as Account, in one of the following ways:
    A: **(B)** - Either by creating the sObject or by retrieving a persistent record from Salesforce using SOQL.

- 3. Which of the following is correct about a generic sObject variable?
    A: **(A)** - Generic sObject variable can be assigned to any specific sObject, standard or custom. Such as Accont or Book__c

</details>
<br>

- [x] 3. **Create a method for inserting accounts.**

*To pass this challenge, create an Apex class that inserts a new account named after an incoming parameter. If the account is successfully inserted, the method should return the account record. If a DML exception occurs, the method should return null.*

<details><summary>üë£Stepsüë£</summary>

>   The Apex class must be called AccountHandler and be in the public scope
-       The Apex class must have a public static method called insertNewAccount
-       The method must accept an incoming string as a parameter, which will be used to create the Account name
-       The method must insert the account into the system and then return the record
-       The method must also accept an empty string, catch the failed DML and then return null.
</details>
<br>

‚ùå**I completed the challenge, but in another Org, I will remake this challenge later**‚ùå

<br>

- [x] 4 - **Create an Apex class that returns contacts based on incoming parameters.**

*Create a class that has a method accepting two strings. The method searches for contacts that have a last name matching the first string and a mailing postal code matching the second. It gets the ID and Name of those contacts and returns them.*

<details><summary>üë£Stepsüë£</summary>

>   The Apex class must be called ContactSearch and be in the public scope
-       The Apex class must have a public static method called searchForContacts
-       The method must accept two incoming strings as parameters
-       The method should then find any contact that has a last name matching the first string, and mailing postal code (API name: MailingPostalCode) matching the second string
-       The method should finally return a list of Contact records of type List that includes the ID and Name fields
</details>
<br>

‚ùå**I completed the challenge, but in another Org, I will remake this challenge later**‚ùå
<br>

- [x] 5 - **Create an Apex class that returns both contacts and leads based on a parameter.**

*To pass this challenge, create an Apex class that returns both contacts and leads that have first or last name matching the incoming parameter.*

<details><summary>üë£Stepsüë£</summary>

>   The Apex class must be called ContactAndLeadSearch and be in the public scope
-       The Apex class must have a public static method called searchContactsAndLeads
-       The method must accept an incoming string as a parameter
-       The method should then find any contact or lead that matches the string as part of either the first or last name
-       The method should finally use a return type of List<List< sObject>>
-       NOTE: Because SOSL indexes data for searching, you must create a Contact record and Lead record before checking this challenge. Both records must have the last name Smith. The challenge uses these records for the SOSL search
